# GridWatch Python Client (v1.1)

A robust, autonomous grid logic controller for **Bitcoin Mining, HPC (High-Performance Computing), and Flexible Industrial Loads.**

This client interfaces with the **GridWatch API** to monitor real-time power grid conditions (LMP Settlements, Stress Index) across US ISOs (ERCOT, PJM, SPP, NYISO, MISO and ISO-NE). It automatically curtails power during volatility and crucially **safely restores power** when conditions normalize. [Get API Key Here](https://rapidapi.com/cnorris1316/api/gridwatch-us-telemetry)

## What's New in v1.1: "Smart Resume"
* **Auto-Resume (Revenue Recovery):** The script no longer requires human intervention to restart. It detects when pricing returns to safe levels and automatically sends "Resume" commands to your fleet.
* **15-Minute Hardware Debounce:** To protect Power Supply Units (PSUs) and sensitive compute hardware from rapid cycling (flapping), the grid must remain in a "Normal" state for a defined cooldown period before a restart is authorized.
* **State Awareness:** The client tracks local state to prevent API spam. It will not send repeated "Stop" commands to a facility that is already curtailed.

## Features
* **Ultra-Low Latency:** Polls 5-minute settlement intervals with <50ms API response time.
* **Multi-ISO Support:** Native support for ERCOT, PJM, NYISO, MISO, SPP and ISO-NE.
* **Agnostic Integration:**
    * **Foreman / HiveOS:** Native handlers for mining fleet management.
    * **Proxmox (AI/HPC):** Graceful shutdown (ACPI) signals to protect filesystem integrity during power events.
    * **Webhooks / SSH:** Generic triggers for Building Management Systems (BMS) or custom SCADA.
    * **Local Shell Scripts:** Direct GPIO/PDU control for homelabs.

## Logic Flow (v1.1)

The client operates on a continuous loop (5-minute polling interval):

1.  **Poll GridWatch API:** Retrieves latest LMP and Grid Stress metrics.
2.  **Evaluate Thresholds:** Compares current price/stress index against your `PRICE_CAP` and/or `STRESS_CAP`.
3.  **Action Decision:**
    * **🔴 CRITICAL EVENT:** If Price > Cap and/or Stress > Cap:
        * *Action:* Send **STOP** command immediately.
        * *State:* Mark facility as `CURTAILED`.
    * **🟢 RECOVERY EVENT:** If Price < Cap and/or Stress < Cap:
        * *Check:* Has the grid been normal for `COOLDOWN_MINUTES`?
        * *Action:* If YES, send **START/RESUME** command.
        * *State:* Mark facility as `RUNNING`.

## Configuration

This client is designed as a **standalone script** for maximum reliability. You configure it by editing the variables at the top of the `.py` file directly.

### Standard Setup
Open `gridwatch_kill_switch.py` and edit the **Configuration** section:

```python
# --- CONFIGURATION ---
RAPIDAPI_KEY = "YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY_HERE"  # Get this from RapidAPI
REGION = "ERCOT"       # Options: PJM, MISO, ERCOT, SPP, NYISO, ISO-NE

# Safety Thresholds
PRICE_CAP = 200        # Shut down if price > $200/MWh
STRESS_CAP = 90        # Shut down if grid stress > 90%
COOLDOWN_MINUTES = 15  # Minutes grid must be NORMAL before resuming
```

### Enterprise Integrations
If you use a management platform, use the specific script found in the `integrations/` folder.

#### 1. Foreman Users (Miners)
Use `integrations/foreman_trigger.py`:
```python
FOREMAN_ENABLED = True
FOREMAN_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_FOREMAN_TOKEN"
FOREMAN_MINER_IDS = [123, 456] # List of Miner IDs to control
```

#### 2. HiveOS Users (Miners)
Use `integrations/hiveos_trigger.py`:
```python
HIVE_ENABLED = True
HIVE_TOKEN = "YOUR_HIVE_API_TOKEN"
HIVE_FARM_ID = 123456
HIVE_WORKER_IDS = [112233, 445566]
```

#### 3. Proxmox Users (AI / HPC)
Use `integrations/proxmox_trigger.py`.
*Note: This executes a "Graceful Shutdown" (SIGTERM) to prevent data corruption.*
```python
PROXMOX_ENABLED = True
PROXMOX_HOST = "192.168.1.X"      # IP of Proxmox Server
PROXMOX_USER = "root@pam"
PROXMOX_PASSWORD = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
PROXMOX_NODE = "pve"              # Node name
TARGET_VMS = [100, 101, 102]      # List of VM IDs to manage
```

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Norris-Eng/gridwatch-kill-switch.git](https://github.com/Norris-Eng/gridwatch-kill-switch.git)
   cd gridwatch-kill-switch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the script:**
   Open the script matching your use case (e.g., `gridwatch_kill_switch.py` or `integrations/proxmox_trigger.py`) in a text editor and paste your API keys.

4. **Run the client:**
   ```bash
   # For generic usage:
   python gridwatch_kill_switch.py

   # For Foreman users:
   python integrations/foreman_trigger.py

   # For Proxmox users:
   python integrations/proxmox_trigger.py
   ```
